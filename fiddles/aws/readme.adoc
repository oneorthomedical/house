= Amazon Web Services

I finally finished my bachelor's degree in 2015.  At 40 I graduated Cum Laude from the Illinois Institute of
Technology's Information and Technology Management program.  The achievement took nearly eight years of
my life, cost nearly 80K.  In hind sight, I wish I would have just spent that time (and money) studying and
mastering AWS.  Anyway, life goes on and here we are--time to make-up for lost time. This directory is
dedicated to my notes and `fiddles` involving AWS.  At the outset, this just means markdown files written
while watching lectures on link:http://acloud.guru[acloud.guru].
